#+TITLE: TEI Workflow Reproducibility Examples
#+AUTHOR: Patrick McAllister

This repository provdies examples for [TODO -> Article].


The idea is to run all the transformations in the example directories
(~./example-*~) without changing the state of the repository.  Any
change would indicate that the transformations are not reproducible.

The suggested way to run the transformations is:

#+begin_src bash
  make clean
  make all
  git status
#+end_src

The last git command should output "nothing to commit, working tree clean".
